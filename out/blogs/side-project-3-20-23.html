  <h1>Side Project Log 3/20/2023</h1>
<p>Spring break just wrapped up. I wrote a <a href="">blog</a> last week about the side projects that I was planning on 
doing. I wanted to provide an update on what I got done, and figured I&#39;d turn it into a recurring thing.</p>
<p>This side project log covers work done from 3/13/2023 - 3/20/2023</p>

<p>I managed to move my website over to tab-based navigation pretty early on in the break. It just involved setting
up a navbar component and then using react-navigation to navigate between pages. I also managed to 
update my projects page to be more compact and readable. </p>
<p>There is still work to be done on making it look better, but I mostly believe that
it&#39;s just going to be somewhat minor tweaks.</p>

<p>I managed to finish this one. I learned a lot about Rust and I&#39;ve gained an appreciation for
Rust&#39;s enforcement of good programming habits, and I really like how error handling is done.</p>
<p>Working with Serenity was pretty easy as it mirrored some of the other Discord SDKs I&#39;ve used
before.</p>

<p><strong>The below projects had minimal/no work done on them:</strong> RingGold, NWS Container Deployment Service, and VerifiedBot </p>
