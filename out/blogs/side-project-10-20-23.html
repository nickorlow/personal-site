  <h1>Side Project Log 10/20/2023</h1>
<p>This side project log covers work done from 8/15/2023 - 10/20/2023</p>

<h2 id="anthracite">Anthracite</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/nickorlow/anthracite">[ GitHub Repo ]</a>
<p>
  Anthracite is a web server written in C++. The site you're reading this on 
  right now is hosted on Anthracite. I wrote it to deepen my knowledge of C++ and networking protocols. My 
  main focus of Anthracite is performance. While developing anthracite,
  I have been exploring different optimization techniques and benchmarking
  Anthracite against popular web servers such as NGINX and Apache. 
  Anthracite supports HTTP/1.1 and only supports GET requests to request 
  files stored on a server. 
</p>

<p>
  Anthracite currently performs on par with NGINX and Apache when making
  1000 requests for a 50MB file using 100 threads in a Docker container.
  To achieve this performance, I used memory profilers to find
  out what caused large or repeated memory copies to occur. I then updated
  those sections of code to remove or minimize these copies. I also 
  made it so that Anthracite caches all files it can serve in memory. This
  avoids unnecessary and costly disk reads. The implementation of this is 
  subpar, as it requires that the server be restarted whenever the files 
  it is serving are changed for the updates to be detected by Anthracite.
</p>

<p>
  I intend to make further performance improvements, specifically in the request 
  parser. I also plan to implement HTTP/2.0.

<h2 id="yacemu">Yet Another Chip Eight Emulator (yacemu)</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/nickorlow/yacemu">[ GitHub Repo ]</a>
<p>
  YACEMU is an interpreter for the CHIP-8 instruction set written in C. My main 
  goal when writing it was to gain more insight into how emulation works. I had
  previous experience with this from when I worked on an emulator for a slimmed-down 
  version of X86 called <a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~reeves.92/CSE2421sp13/PracticeProblemsY86.pdf">Y86</a>. 
  So far, I've been able to get most instructions working. I need to work on adding
  input support so that users can interact with programs running in yacemu. It has
  been fairly uncomplicated and easy to write thus far. After I complete it, I would
  like to work on an emulator for a real device such as the GameBoy (This might be 
  biting off more than I can chew).
</p>

<h2 id="nick-vim">Nick VIM</h2>
<p>
  Over the summer while I was interning, I began using VIM as my primary
  text editor. I used a preconfigured version of it (<a href="https://nvchad.com/">NvChad</a>) to save time, as 
  setting everything up can take a while. After using it for a few months, I began 
  making my own configuration for VIM, taking what I liked from NvChad and leaving
  behind the parts that I didn't like as much.
</p>

<p>
  One important part of Nick VIM was ensuring that it was portable between different
  machines. I wanted the machine to have as few dependencies as possible so that I 
  could get NickVIM set up on any computer in a couple of minutes. This will be especially 
  useful when working on my School's lab machines and when switching to new computers
  in the future. I achieved this by dockerizing Nick VIM. This is based on what one of
  my co-workers does with their VIM setup. The Docker container contains
  all the dependencies for each language server. Whenever you edit a file with Nick Vim, 
  the following script runs:
</p>

<code lang="bash">
echo Starting container...
cur_dir=`pwd`
container_name=${cur_dir////$'_'}
container_name="${container_name:1}_$RANDOM"
docker run --name $container_name --network host -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/work -d nick-vim {{ body_area }}> /dev/null

echo Execing into container...
docker exec -w /work -it $container_name bash 

echo Stopping container in background...
docker stop $container_name {{ body_area }}> /dev/null {{ body_area }}
</code>

<p>
  This code creates a new container, forwards the host's clipboard to the container, and 
  mounts the current directory inside the container for editing. 
</p>

<h2 id="secane">Secane</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKRehO7FH_s">[ Video Demo ]</a></p>
<p>
  Secane was a simple ChatGPT wrapper that I wrote to practice for the behavioral part of 
  job interviews. It takes your resume, information about the company, and information about
  the role you're interviewing for. It also integrates with OpenAI's whisper, allowing you 
  to simulate talking out your answers. I made it with Next.JS.
