  <h1>Side Project Log 3/27/2023</h1>
<p>This side project log covers work done from 3/20/2023 - 3/27/2023</p>
<h2 id="septa-site">SEPTA Site</h2>
<p>I started a new project that aimed to recreate parts of SEPTA&#39;s website with a more elegant UI, and using
SEPTA&#39;s new &quot;SEPTA Metro&quot; wayfinding. The main goal with this project was to help me learn Svelte. I also had 
to reverse-engineer the APIs on septakey.org in order to authenticate a user and get their trip history. </p>
<p>In terms of Svelte, I really enjoyed working with it and overall I found it much more elegant and easier to work
with than React. I didn&#39;t like the way it handled client-server interaction with its serverside functions. </p>
<p>I have not made this open source yet and do not intend to until it&#39;s more polished.</p>
<h2 id="-verified-bot-https-github-com-benaubin-verified-bot-"><a href="https://github.com/benaubin/verified-bot">Verified Bot</a></h2>
<p>I made all the necessary changes and tests to get VerifiedBot working. It is now waiting on my friend Ben 
to merge my PR with the changes outlined in my <a href="https://nickorlow.com/blog/spring-break-2023">spring break blog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-mahantongo-https-github-com-nickorlow-mahantongo-"><a href="https://github.com/nickorlow/mahantongo">Mahantongo</a></h2>
<p>I created some QoL features, such as using Discord&#39;s embeds instead of sending regular text messages, showing which board 
a post was on, and fixing some bugs.</p>
