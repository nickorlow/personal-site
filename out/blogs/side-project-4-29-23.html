  <h1>Side Project Log 4/29/2023</h1>
<p>This side project log covers work done from 3/27/2023 - 4/29/2023</p>
<p>This side project log is a bit late due to it being a busy month of school, but today is my last day!</p>
<h2 id="septa-site">SEPTA Site</h2>
<p>This week, I published SEPTA Site on Github, you can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/nickorlow/septa-site">github.com/nickorlow/septa-site</a>.</p>
<p>I made a few tweaks to it in terms of styling and also wrote a descriptive README to give people instructions on how to run it as I don&#39;t want
to host it myself since it handles credentials from another service.</p>
<h2 id="squirrel">SQUIRREL</h2>
<p>SQUIRREL, short for SQL Query Util-Izing Rust&#39;s Reliable and Efficient Logic, is a SQL database that I am writing in Rust. Currently, it can
parse CREATE TABLE commands, and works with the data types varchar and int. I plan to implement basic CRUD operations, then add JOINs, and
then try to make it wire-compatible with Postgres.</p>
<p>This project is currently not open-sourced as I am waiting to add more features and polish it up more.</p>
<h2 id="swole-control">Swole Control</h2>
<p>This one isn&#39;t a <em>personal</em> project, however it is a project that I worked on with a group. We began working on it in February as a part of a
club at UT called Texas Convergent. We recently presented it at the club&#39;s demo day and won the prize for having the best business.</p>
<p>Swole Control is an app that monitors machine usage at a gym on a machine-by-machine level, providing gym goers with information about what machines
are free (this is a major pain point as a gym goer myself). It also provides gym owners with statistics on which machines are most popular, providing
them valuable insights into their business.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we built hardware that consisted of an ESP-32 micro controller and an ultrasonic distance sensor. This hardware is mounted on a gym machine
and it measures the distance to the nearest object. It then sends this measurement to a Rust backend which stores it in a Firestore database (although we had
a fork of it that worked with Postgres). The backend then uses these measurements and compares them to a baseline to determine if there is a user at a machine.
Our mobile app then reads this from the Firestore database (it&#39;s planned to have it read this from the API to have a better-defined application boundary). The
frontend is written in React Native.</p>
