    <h2>Nick Web Services (NWS)</h2>
    <i>C#, Kubernetes, Rancher, and HAProxy</i>
    <a href="https://nws.nickorlow.com">[ Project Website ]</a>
    <p>
      Nick Web Services is a cloud infrastructure provider service that I created and run.
      It allows people to deploy containerized versions of their web apps across our multiple
      servers. It provides geo-distributed high availability by default with no extra configuration
      needed from users hosting their webapp with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardware-wise we use old Dell PowerEdge servers running Proxmox. We then have VMs running
      in Proxmox that run Kubernetes clusters. We have 4 clusters currently: Austin, Hill Country,
      Schuylkill, and Philadelphia. The deployments are managed through GitOps with Rancher Fleet.

    <h2>CavCash</h2>
    <i>C#, Kubernetes, SQL Server, and MongoDB</i>
    <a href="https://cavcash.com">[ Project Website ]</a>
    <p>
      CavCash was a company that I founded which built a debit-based payment system similar to 
      PayPal and Venmo. I assembled a 5 person team and took on a technical role in the company,
      writing most of our backend codebase. Our backend used C#, ASP.NET, Microsoft SQL Server,
      and MongoDB. Our infrastructure changed throughout the lifetime of the company, initially
      it was on Microsoft Azure using Azure App Service. We then pivoted to AWS using Elastic
      Beanstalk. We also ran on Google Cloud Platform using Compute Engine. Finally, we setup our
      own servers in-house and managed our deployments with Kubernetes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We launched in 2021, with the ability to send money between real banks using the ACH network.
      We ended up processing a few hundred dollars in transaction volume before ultimately shutting
      down due to a lack of funding. The website is now back up and everything works as it did in 
      2021, except adding funds from a bank account is not supported.

    <h2>SQUIRREL</h2>
    <i>Rust</i>
    <a href="https://github.com/nickorlow/squirrel">[ GitHub Repo ]</a>
    <p>
      SQUIRREL stands for SQL Query Util-Izing Rust's Reliable and Efficient Logic. It is a SQL database 
      that I am writing in Rust. Currently, it can create tables, insert data into tables, and select all 
      data from a given table. The biggest challenge so far has been writing the parser. My next steps are 
      to add WHERE clauses to SELECT statements, allow column filtering in SELECT statements, and add DELETE
      statements.

  <div>
    <h2>Olney</h2>
    <i>Rust, Postgres, Svelte, TypeScript, and OpenAI's API</i>
    <a href="https://github.com/nickorlow/olney">[ GitHub Repo ]</a>
    <p>
      Olney is a job application tracker that aims to be better than using a <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> board or a spreadsheet.
      It allows users to create jobs and log custom events such as interviews, assessments, and other communication.

    <h2>SEPTA Site</h2>
    <i>Svelte, TypeScript</i>
    <a href="https://github.com/nickorlow/septa-site">[ GitHub Repo ]</a>
    <p>
      SEPTA Site is a website that I created which can get your trip history, SEPTA Key balance, 
      and ridership statistics for your SEPTA Key. It utilizes SEPTA's new metro wayfinding instead
      of their current wayfinding. I wrote the project to get a basic introduction to Svelte and 
      so that I could try to improve upon the UX of SEPTA's current website and mobile app.
