<h2 id="squirrel">SQUIRREL</h2>
<p>
  SQUIRREL has been updated to work with INSERT INTO and SELECT queries. I also refactored much of the codebase to do error handling more elegantly and to make the parser
  more extensible. Here's a screenshot of table creation, data insertion, and data selection: 
</p>

<p>
  The biggest challenge of this part was working on the parser which has now been written three times. The approaches to the parsing were:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Stepping through whitespace:</b> <p>This was my initial and naive approach to the problem. I split the input string by its whitespace
    and then queried values by referencing their indexes in the split string. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Regex:</b> <p>This approach was cleaner than the first and led to a small parser, however it required an external dependency (which I'm 
    trying to minimize), and would make it hard to add additional features to commands later down the line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Finite state machine:</b> <p>This solution was more verbose than the others, however it allows for easier development. This method works 
    by splitting the query string into tokens. Tokens are the smallest piece of data that a parser recognizes. SQUIRREL gets them by splitting
    the input by delimiters and using the split list as tokens (excluding whitespace) SQUIRREL recognizes the following characters as delimiters: 
    </p>

    <code>
      ' ', ',', ';', '(', ')'
    </code>
    
    <p>
      This means that the string "INSERT INTO test (id) VALUES (12);" would be parsed into the list: "INSERT", "INTO", "test", "(", "id", etc..
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we have our list of tokens, we iterate through them starting at a default state and perform a certain task for the given state, which 
      usually includes switching to another state. We do this until we reach the end state. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, with the above insert statement, we would start in the IntoKeyword state which would ensure that "INTO" is the current token. 
      We would then transition to the TableName state which would read the table name and store it in the ParsedCommand struct we're returning. We 
      would then move to the ColumnListBegin state which would look for an opening parenthesis, and switch the state to ColumnName. This process
      continues with the other parts of the query until the Semicolon state is reached which checks that the statement ends with a semicolon, then 
      returns the ParsedCommand struct. 
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Next steps for this are to add column selection to SELECT statements and add WHERE clauses to SELECT statements.

<h2 id="olney">Olney</h2>
<p>
  I added a feature to the Olney API which scans the <a href="https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2024-Internships">pittcsc (now Simplify) summer internships Github repo</a> 
  and parses the data into JSON format. I parsed the markdown file they have uisng regex which was relatively simple. There were some issues during development due to the 
  changing structure of the markdown file. These issues are being fixed on a rolling basis. I expect the changes to slowdown now that the transition from pittcsc to Simplify
  is complete. You can access the JSON at <a href="https://olney.nickorlow.com/jobs">olney.nickorlow.com/jobs</a>.
