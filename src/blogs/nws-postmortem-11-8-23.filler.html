<h1>NWS Incident Postmortem 11/08/2023</h1>

<p>
  On November 8th, 2023 at approximately 09:47 UTC, NWS suffered
  a complete outage. This outage resulted in the downtime of all 
  services hosted on NWS and the downtime of the NWS Management
  Engine and the NWS dashboard.
</p>

<p>
  The incident lasted 38 minutes after which it was automatically
  resolved and all services were restored. This is NWS' first
  outage event of 2023.
</p>

<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>
  NWS utilizes several tactics to ensure uptime. A component of
  this is load balancing and failover. This service is currently
  provided by Cloudflare at the DNS level. Cloudflare sends
  health check requests to NWS servers at specified intervals. If 
  it detects that one of the servers is down, it will remove the
  A record from entry.nws.nickorlow.com for that server (this domain
  is where all services on NWS direct their traffic via a 
  CNAME). 
</p>

<p>
  At around 09:47 UTC, Cloudflare detected that our servers in 
  Texas (Austin and Hill Country) were down. It did not detect an 
  error, but rather an HTTP timeout. This is an indication that the
  server may have lost network connectivity. When Cloudflare detected that the
  servers were down, it removed their A records from the 
  entry.nws.nickorlow.com domain. Since NWS Pennsylvania servers
  have been undergoing maintenance since August 2023, this left no 
  servers able to serve requests routed to entry.nws.nickorlow.com,
  resulting in the outage.
</p>

<p>
  NWS utilizes UptimeRobot for monitoring the uptime statistics of
  services on NWS and NWS servers. This is the source of the 
  statistics shown on the NWS status page. 
</p>

<p>
  UptimeRobot did not detect either of the Texas NWS servers as being
  offline for the duration of the outage. This is odd, as UptimeRobot
  and Cloudflare did not agree on the status of NWS servers. Logs
  on NWS servers showed that requests from UptimeRobot were being
  served while no requests from Cloudflare were shown in the logs. 
</p>

<p>
  No firewall rules existed that could have blocked the healthcheck traffic from Cloudflare
  for either of the NWS servers. There was no other configuration
  found that would have blocked these requests. As these servers
  are on different networks inside different buildings in different
  parts of Texas, their networking equipment is entirely separate.
  This rules out any failure of networking equipment owned
  by NWS. This leads us to believe that the issue may have been
  caused due to an internet traffic anomaly, although we are currently
  unable to confirm that this is the cause of the issue.
</p>

<p>
  This is being actively investigated to find a more concrete root
  cause. This postmortem will be updated if any new information is 
  found.
</p>

<p>
  A similar event occurred on November 12th, 2023 lasting for 2 seconds.
</p>

<h2>Fix</h2>
<p>
  The common factor between both of these servers is that they both use
  Spectrum for their ISP and that they are located near Austin, Texas.
  The Pennsylvania server maintenance will be expedited so that we have 
  servers online that operate with no commonalities.
</p>

<p>
  NWS will also investigate other methods of failover and load 
  balancing.
