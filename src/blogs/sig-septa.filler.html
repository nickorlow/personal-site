<h1>How to get to Susquehanna on SEPTA</h1>
<!--<p>
    As a preface, all of this is assuming you're an 
    intern trying to get to Susquehanna from the Windsor 
    Suites. If you're staying elsewhere in center 
    city, this guide is sill useful to you, however 
    the specific stations that I mention may be further 
    away from your hotel/apartment. I'd reccomend 
    checking to see if any of the routes I menton 
    have stops closer to you. 
</p>

<p> 
    SEPTA recently began replacing signs and renaming 
    lines as a part of their "<a href="https://wwww.septa.org/metro/">SEPTA Metro</a>" campaign.
    This guide will use the older SEPTA terminology, 
    as it's mostly what's being used still. To avoid confusion:
    <ul> 
        <li>The "B Line" refers to the Broad Street Line/Broad-Ridge Spur</li>
        <li>The "L Line" (aka the "El") refers to the Market-Frankford Line</li>
        <li>The "T Lines" refer to the trolley lines excluding Girard Av.</li> 
    </ul>
</p>

<p> 
    Other lines like the NHSL were also renamed, but they're not 
    discussed in this guide.

<h2>General SEPTA tips (please read!)</h2>
<ul>
    <!--<li>
        Look at your bus driver when the bus pulls up to the stop. 
        Make sure they see you, if they don't see anyone, they will 
        skip the stop.
    </li>
    <li>
        Get to your stop (whether it's bus/rr/subway) at least 
        5 minutes early. If your ride is running early, they will 
        likely leave early as well.
</li>
    <li> 
        Get a <a href="https://www.septakey.org/">SEPTA Key</a>. While you can use a credit card on SEPTA, 
        if you need to use Regional Rail on a trip starting in 
        center city, you MUST have a SEPTA Key. It's nice to have
        so you're not in a rush if the bus is cancelled, and you 
        need to take the train.
</li>-->
    <li>
        Trains/subways are almost always more reliable than busses. 
        Operator avaliability and traffic cause the bus system to 
        have large unpredictable delays. 
    </li>
    <li> 
        Get information about what time your bus/train will arrive from 
        the SEPTA app. Google Maps is very bad with showing delays/cancellations.
    </li>
    <li> 
        The <a href="https://transitapp.com/">Transit App</a> is another good and reliable app for transit 
        directions, and also the easiest to use.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Whenever riding <u>non regional rail</u> SEPTA services, you receive 
        2 free transfers to other <u>non regional rail</u> SEPTA services. This 
        means that if you take the bus/trolley/subway, you can take 2 more
        bus/trolley/subway rides for free <u>within the next 2 hours</u>. 
        You do not need to transfer to the same mode of transit. For example: 
        you can transfer from bus to subway or bus to bus or anything else you'd 
        like. <u>You must pay with a SEPTA Key or a contactless credit/debit card 
            to receive this benefit, and you must use the same payment method 
        for all transfers</u>
    </li>
    <li> 
        The niceness/cleanliness of SEPTA's transit modes usually ranks: 
        <ol>
            <li>Regional Rail</li> 
            <li>Bus/Trolley</li>
            <li>Subway</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<!--<h2>Non-Reccommended Routes</h2>
<p>I'd only take these in circumstances where all of the above are significantly delayed and

    <li>Time: 10 min walk to 15th Street + 15 min subway ride + 5-15 min waiting for bus + 25 min bus ride = <u>55 min - 1hr 5 min</u></li>
