    I'm a computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin graduating this May! I'm currently living in PA while finishing my final classes online. I'm particularly
    interested in computer architecture and systems programming, with a focus on 
    performance-critical applications.

  <p>
    I run <a href="https://nws.nickorlow.com">Nick Web Services (NWS)</a>, a side project 
    that provides geo-distributed container hosting using Kubernetes on bare metal servers. 
    It achieved 100% uptime for over a year.

    Outside of computers, I enjoy biking and weightlifting. I'm also a public transit enthusiast
    and I take pictures of trains that I see and train stations that I visit. I also like to 
    play poker. I'm not particularly good except for

        one tournament run I had, where I came in 5th out of roughly 150.
